# soccer_season_prediction
The goal of this project is to predict a soccer final ranking based on what happened until some leg

# Introduction

Measures implemented to contain Covid-19 outbreaks impacted all aspect of life. In particular soccer championship had been forced to pause their season. In France, it meant a final stop after 27 full legs and positions were frozen. The decision was met with outrage by clubs that were not in positions they might have been had the season run to its normal end because it had huge consequences for them; from a sportive point of view as well as a financial one.

As a soccer fan and a data scientist, I saw a great opportunity to combine both field in one new original (at least for me!) project : predicting the final ranking given the course of the championship is known up to some leg.

The project is decomposed in 5 steps :
- getting the data
- exploring it and get some insights
- build different type of models and pick the most interesting
- moving the workflow from notebooks to scripts 
- writing an app with Streamlit.

Each of these steps will be described in their respective sections

# Getting the data

(data was scrapped from L'Ã‰quipe, a french newspaper focused on sports --> full soccer data available from season 2004-2005)
TBD 

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Evolution of several kpis based upon final rank
TBD 

# EDA for 2019-2020 season

TODO

# Models

### The naive one
TBD 

### Regression type
TBD 

### Classification type
TBD 

### Ranking type
TBD 

### What metrics ?
TBD 

### Results
TBD 

# Notebooks to scripts
TBD 

# The app
TBD 

# Miscellaneous

As an additional way to achieve my objective to predict final ranking, I wanted to predict the number of goals a team would score at its next game.

--> Failure, but I learnt that 30% of the time, the team would score 1 goal.
TBD 

# Conclusion

In no way, this project is aimed to be used for any claim in front of courts; it was just for my fun. 
That being said, the fact that results are not as good as expected at the start is a good thing for soccer. Indeed, the uncertainty about games' outcome makes ir an exciting sport to follow and argue with friends (and other fans).

Went through an entire experimental project from scrapping the data, exploring and prototyping in notebooks, translating 
those to scripts and displaying insight and results in a Streamlit app.

## Side note
I consider my notebooks as rough drafts before turning to .py script with content I deem sufficient; so notebooks are not very user-friendly.

Best practises requires providing docstrings and variable typing. As it is personal and been written over the course of several months (when I had free time and motivation to go on)
and not meant to be used widely by the public, it didn't seem to me to be as important.
